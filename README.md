EasyList
========

EasyList is a fork of ListIt2 designed for CmsMadeSimple 2.x exclusively


ListIt2 has discontinued, this is a fork of it, only for the upcoming version 2.0 of CMSMS. **Don't use it with the actual versions of CMSMS 1.11. Only for testing with Beta version CMSMS 2.0**. 

EasyList allows you to create lists that you can display throughout your website. You could make a simple FAQ or Testimonials feature with this module. The web developer defines fields to constrain what data the client can enter. A number of field types can be specified :
 * text input
 * checkbox
 * text area
 * select date
 * upload file
 * select file
 * dropdown

Additional instructions can be set for each type, for example, input field size, max length, WYSIWYG editor, possible drop down values, possible file extensions, directory paths for file selections, date formats.
